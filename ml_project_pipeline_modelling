## Business Domain Knowledge

Business problem
Questions

- How does the price distribution look like in 2018-2019
- How would the sales prices look like during 5 or 10 months
- Which car models are highly recommended with the highest sales?
- What are the main factors that influence the sales prices?

Hypothesis

- Factors like fuel types, engine power, mileage are the factors influencing the sales prices

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Linear Regression

** Be more specific with these steps
** Study the dataset thoroughly

## 1. Data Preprocessing

- Remove feature "maker_key" and feature_1 until feature_8
- Filter + focus on 4 main bmw models: coupe, tourer, X, M

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Explore price distribution for registration period and sales period
- Explore main factors that affects the price data

## 3. Feature Engineering

- continue to finish calculating fuel consumption
- convert from mpg to kml
